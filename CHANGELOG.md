# Changelog

All notable changes to Raven are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation
- Refreshed installation links (latest releases), CLI descriptions (`-c` type-check), **rvpm** (`init`, `run`, `fmt`, `fmt --check`), and optional **`[fmt]`** in `rv.toml`.
- Added **Getting Started → rvpm and formatting** (`docs/getting-started/rvpm-and-format.md`).
- Corrected examples README (removed obsolete `-f` flag; document `raven file.rv`).
- **RVPM_DESIGN.md** updated for implemented commands and real module path notes.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Language type spelling standardized to lowercase `string` in Raven source/docs/examples/editor assets.
- CLI/package version bumped to `1.4.0`.

### Fixed

- Method chaining support (`object.method1().method2()`)
- Field access with array indexing (`object.field[index]`)
- Comprehensive standard library (math, collections, string, time, filesystem, network, testing)
- WiX installer for Windows (401KB MSI)

### Changed
- CLI interface now matches Python/Node.js behavior
- Enhanced error messages and type checking
- Improved module loading and resolution

### Fixed
- Release build compilation issues (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION)
- Complex assignment parsing
- Method calls on struct fields
